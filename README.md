## Description

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _This is a great place_
* This is just a website (http://netzeln.github.io/Ping-Pong-Code-Review/)


## Known Bugs

_there are two sets of files, files ending in "2" are a set of files I created to make the code work to prove to myself that I could make the project work, however they by pass the frustrating barrier of spec testing, so while they actually work, they are "bugs"_

_WEEKEND UPDATE ("with Seth and Amy (or Norm Macdonald)"):  over the weekend I went back to try to tackle what I wanted to do in a way that would use Business Logic and pass spec-tests.  There is a branch called weekend-refactor that is worth looking at to see how I partially solved that.  It only uses one function for the business logic area, and uses another function (that calls the first function) to write the results._
