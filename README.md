#### By _**Nic Netzel (with thanks to previous week's Pair Program Partners)**_

## Description

_This page will print a list of numbers up to a user-submitted number, replacing multiples of 3 with "ping", multiples of 5 with "pong" and multiples of 15 with "ping pong"_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _This is a great place_
* This is just a website



## Known Bugs

_there are two sets of files. Files with no numerical endings are the ones that meet the barest minimum of the requirements for the code-review, they took twice as long to make work.
 files ending in "2" are a set of files I created to make the code work to prove to myself that I could make the project work, however they by pass the frustrating barrier of spec testing, so while they actually work, they are "bugs".  One could call them the "refactored" version of the code, but they were written first_
